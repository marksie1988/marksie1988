**Hey, there!**

**I’m Steve, and I’m passionate about creating educational tech content for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.**

Through my blog, I’m sharing engaging tutorials, and write-ups that make complex topics easy to understand. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just someone curious about IT, my content offers valuable insights and provides practical knowledge.

Why am I doing all this? Because I just have a genuine love for IT and sharing my knowledge with others. I believe that by presenting what I've learned, I can inspire people to explore and experiment with technology themselves.

## Meet our Community
And because I believe in the power of connection and collaboration, I’ve created a tech community on Discord. It's a fantastic place to connect with other IT professionals, tech enthusiasts and others who share your passion.

https://discord.totaldebug.uk

## Write-Ups and Tutorials
Don't forget to check out my written tutorials and documentation. You'll find helpful example code snippets, templates, and more to support your learning process.

- [Blog][website] - This site contains all of my blog posts, tutorials, thoughts and other useful articles.
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/marksie1988/dotfiles) - My personal configuration files on Ubuntu
- [Homelab](https://github.com/totaldebug/homelab) - Coming Soon... This is my entire Homelab documentation, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

## Support me and make a difference

Your sponsorship is worth far more than money to me. It tells me that the software I've written has impacted you in your day-to-day life. It acknowledges the humanity of the people who build and maintain the software you use every day. It says "thank you" to a human who rarely gets thanked.

Any money that I receive as part of your sponsorship will go first towards defraying the costs of the projects on which I work; but everything else will get channelled back to the community.

Remember, ***supporting me is entirely optional.*** Your choice to become a member or not won't change your access to my resources. You are also welcome to reach out to me on Discord, if you have any questions or feedback.
